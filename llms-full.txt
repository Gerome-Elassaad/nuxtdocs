### Extended Thinking

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

When extended thinking is in CodinIT.dev, the model generates `thinking` content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response.
CodinIT.dev users can leverage this by checking the `Enable Extended Thinking` box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.

**Key Aspects of Extended Thinking:**

- **Supported Models:** This feature is available for select models, including variants of Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Sonnet 3.7. The specific models listed in the "Supported Models" section above with the `:thinking` suffix are pre-configured in CodinIT.dev to utilize this.
- **Summarized Thinking (Claude 4):** For Claude 4 models, the API returns a summary of the full thinking process to balance insight with efficiency and prevent misuse. You are billed for the full thinking tokens, not just the summary.
- **Streaming:** Extended thinking responses, including the `thinking` blocks, can be streamed.
- **Tool Use & Prompt Caching:** Extended thinking interacts with tool use (requiring thinking blocks to be passed back) and prompt caching (with specific behaviors around cache invalidation and context).

For comprehensive details on how extended thinking works, including API examples, interaction with tool use, prompt caching, and pricing, please refer to the [official Anthropic documentation on Extended Thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking){ariaLabel="Anthropic Extended Thinking Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

### Tips and Notes

- **Prompt Caching:** Claude 3 models support [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching){ariaLabel="Anthropic Prompt Caching Documentation" rel="nofollow"}, which can significantly reduce costs and latency for repeated prompts.
- **Context Window:** Claude models have large context windows (200,000 tokens), allowing you to include a significant amount of code and context in your prompts.
- **Pricing:** Refer to the [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing){ariaLabel="Anthropic Pricing Page" rel="nofollow"} page for the latest pricing information.

# Ollama

CodinIT.dev supports running models locally using Ollama. This approach offers privacy, offline access, and potentially reduced costs. It requires some initial setup and a sufficiently powerful computer. Because of the present state of consumer hardware, it's not recommended to use Ollama with CodinIT.dev as performance will likely be poor for average hardware configurations.

**Website:** <https://ollama.com/>{ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"}

### Setting up Ollama

1. **Download and Install Ollama:**
   Obtain the Ollama installer for your operating system from the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/){ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"} and follow their installation guide. Ensure Ollama is running. You can typically start it with:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
2. **Download a Model:**
   Ollama supports a wide variety of models. A list of available models can be found on the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library){ariaLabel="Ollama Model Library" rel="nofollow"}. Some models recommended for coding tasks include:
   - `codellama:7b-code` (a good, smaller starting point)
   - `codellama:13b-code` (offers better quality, larger size)
   - `codellama:34b-code` (provides even higher quality, very large)
   - `qwen2.5-coder:32b`
   - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` (a solid general-purpose model)
   - `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` (effective for coding)
   - `llama3:8b-instruct-q5_1` (suitable for general tasks)
   :brTo download a model, open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   ollama pull <model_name>
   ```
   :brFor instance:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
3. **Configure the Model's Context Window:**
   By default, Ollama models often use a context window of 2048 tokens, which can be insufficient for many CodinIT.dev requests. A minimum of 12,000 tokens is advisable for decent results, with 32,000 tokens being ideal. To adjust this, you'll modify the model's parameters and save it as a new version. :br First, load the model (using `qwen2.5-coder:32b` as an example):
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
   :brOnce the model is loaded within the Ollama interactive session, set the context size parameter:
   ```text
   /set parameter num_ctx 32768
   ```
   :brThen, save this configured model with a new name:
   ```text
   /save your_custom_model_name
   ```
   :br(Replace `your_custom_model_name` with a name of your choice.)
4. **Configure CodinIT.dev:**
   - Open the CodinIT.dev sidebar (usually indicated by the CodinIT.dev icon).
   - Click the settings gear icon (⚙️).
   - Select "ollama" as the API Provider.
   - Enter the Model name you saved in the previous step (e.g., `your_custom_model_name`).
   - (Optional) Adjust the base URL if Ollama is running on a different machine or port. The default is `http://localhost:11434`.
   - (Optional) Configure the Model context size in CodinIT.dev's Advanced settings. This helps CodinIT.dev manage its context window effectively with your customized Ollama model.

### Tips and Notes

- **Resource Demands:** Running large language models locally can be demanding on system resources. Ensure your computer meets the requirements for your chosen model.
- **Model Choice:** Experiment with various models to discover which best fits your specific tasks and preferences.
- **Offline Capability:** After downloading a model, you can use CodinIT.dev with that model even without an internet connection.
- **Token Usage Tracking:** CodinIT.dev tracks token usage for models accessed via Ollama, allowing you to monitor consumption.
- **Ollama's Own Documentation:** For more detailed information, consult the official [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs){ariaLabel="Ollama Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

5. **(Optional) Custom Base URL:** If you need to use a custom base URL for the Anthropic API, check "Use custom base URL" and enter the URL. Most users won't need to adjust this setting.

### Extended Thinking

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

When extended thinking is in CodinIT.dev, the model generates `thinking` content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response.
CodinIT.dev users can leverage this by checking the `Enable Extended Thinking` box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.

**Key Aspects of Extended Thinking:**

- **Supported Models:** This feature is available for select models, including variants of Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Sonnet 3.7. The specific models listed in the "Supported Models" section above with the `:thinking` suffix are pre-configured in CodinIT.dev to utilize this.
- **Summarized Thinking (Claude 4):** For Claude 4 models, the API returns a summary of the full thinking process to balance insight with efficiency and prevent misuse. You are billed for the full thinking tokens, not just the summary.
- **Streaming:** Extended thinking responses, including the `thinking` blocks, can be streamed.
- **Tool Use & Prompt Caching:** Extended thinking interacts with tool use (requiring thinking blocks to be passed back) and prompt caching (with specific behaviors around cache invalidation and context).

For comprehensive details on how extended thinking works, including API examples, interaction with tool use, prompt caching, and pricing, please refer to the [official Anthropic documentation on Extended Thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking){ariaLabel="Anthropic Extended Thinking Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

### Tips and Notes

- **Prompt Caching:** Claude 3 models support [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching){ariaLabel="Anthropic Prompt Caching Documentation" rel="nofollow"}, which can significantly reduce costs and latency for repeated prompts.
- **Context Window:** Claude models have large context windows (200,000 tokens), allowing you to include a significant amount of code and context in your prompts.
- **Pricing:** Refer to the [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing){ariaLabel="Anthropic Pricing Page" rel="nofollow"} page for the latest pricing information.
- **Rate Limits:** Anthropic has strict rate limits based on [usage tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#requirements-to-advance-tier){ariaLabel="Anthropic API Rate Limits Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

   - `qwen2.5-coder:32b`
   - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` (a solid general-purpose model)
   - `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` (effective for coding)
   - `llama3:8b-instruct-q5_1` (suitable for general tasks)
   :brTo download a model, open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   ollama pull <model_name>
   ```
   :brFor instance:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
3. **Configure the Model's Context Window:**
   By default, Ollama models often use a context window of 2048 tokens, which can be insufficient for many CodinIT.dev requests. A minimum of 12,000 tokens is advisable for decent results, with 32,000 tokens being ideal. To adjust this, you'll modify the model's parameters and save it as a new version. :br First, load the model (using `qwen2.5-coder:32b` as an example):
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
   :brOnce the model is loaded within the Ollama interactive session, set the context size parameter:
   ```text
   /set parameter num_ctx 32768
   ```
   :brThen, save this configured model with a new name:
   ```text
   /save your_custom_model_name
   ```
   :br(Replace `your_custom_model_name` with a name of your choice.)
4. **Configure CodinIT.dev:**
   - Open the CodinIT.dev sidebar (usually indicated by the CodinIT.dev icon).
   - Click the settings gear icon (⚙️).
   - Select "ollama" as the API Provider.
   - Enter the Model name you saved in the previous step (e.g., `your_custom_model_name`).
   - (Optional) Adjust the base URL if Ollama is running on a different machine or port. The default is `http://localhost:11434`.
   - (Optional) Configure the Model context size in CodinIT.dev's Advanced settings. This helps CodinIT.dev manage its context window effectively with your customized Ollama model.

### Tips and Notes

- **Resource Demands:** Running large language models locally can be demanding on system resources. Ensure your computer meets the requirements for your chosen model.
- **Model Choice:** Experiment with various models to discover which best fits your specific tasks and preferences.
- **Offline Capability:** After downloading a model, you can use CodinIT.dev with that model even without an internet connection.

### Configuration in CodinIT.dev

1. **Open CodinIT.dev Settings:** Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the CodinIT.dev panel.
2. **Select Provider:** Choose "Anthropic" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3. **Enter API Key:** Paste your Anthropic API key into the "Anthropic API Key" field.

5. **(Optional) Custom Base URL:** If you need to use a custom base URL for the Anthropic API, check "Use custom base URL" and enter the URL. Most users won't need to adjust this setting.

### Extended Thinking

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

When extended thinking is in CodinIT.dev, the model generates `thinking` content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response.
CodinIT.dev users can leverage this by checking the `Enable Extended Thinking` box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.

**Key Aspects of Extended Thinking:**

- **Supported Models:** This feature is available for select models, including variants of Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Sonnet 3.7. The specific models listed in the "Supported Models" section above with the `:thinking` suffix are pre-configured in CodinIT.dev to utilize this.
- **Summarized Thinking (Claude 4):** For Claude 4 models, the API returns a summary of the full thinking process to balance insight with efficiency and prevent misuse. You are billed for the full thinking tokens, not just the summary.
- **Streaming:** Extended thinking responses, including the `thinking` blocks, can be streamed.
- **Tool Use & Prompt Caching:** Extended thinking interacts with tool use (requiring thinking blocks to be passed back) and prompt caching (with specific behaviors around cache invalidation and context).

For comprehensive details on how extended thinking works, including API examples, interaction with tool use, prompt caching, and pricing, please refer to the [official Anthropic documentation on Extended Thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking){ariaLabel="Anthropic Extended Thinking Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

### Tips and Notes

- **Prompt Caching:** Claude 3 models support [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching){ariaLabel="Anthropic Prompt Caching Documentation" rel="nofollow"}, which can significantly reduce costs and latency for repeated prompts.
- **Context Window:** Claude models have large context windows (200,000 tokens), allowing you to include a significant amount of code and context in your prompts.
- **Pricing:** Refer to the [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing){ariaLabel="Anthropic Pricing Page" rel="nofollow"} page for the latest pricing information.
- **Rate Limits:** Anthropic has strict rate limits based on [usage tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#requirements-to-advance-tier){ariaLabel="Anthropic API Rate Limits Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

# Ollama

CodinIT.dev supports running models locally using Ollama. This approach offers privacy, offline access, and potentially reduced costs. It requires some initial setup and a sufficiently powerful computer. Because of the present state of consumer hardware, it's not recommended to use Ollama with CodinIT.dev as performance will likely be poor for average hardware configurations.

**Website:** <https://ollama.com/>{ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"}

### Setting up Ollama

1. **Download and Install Ollama:**
   Obtain the Ollama installer for your operating system from the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/){ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"} and follow their installation guide. Ensure Ollama is running. You can typically start it with:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
2. **Download a Model:**
   Ollama supports a wide variety of models. A list of available models can be found on the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library){ariaLabel="Ollama Model Library" rel="nofollow"}. Some models recommended for coding tasks include:
   - `codellama:7b-code` (a good, smaller starting point)
   - `codellama:13b-code` (offers better quality, larger size)
   - `codellama:34b-code` (provides even higher quality, very large)
   - `qwen2.5-coder:32b`
   - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` (a solid general-purpose model)
   - `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` (effective for coding)
   - `llama3:8b-instruct-q5_1` (suitable for general tasks)
   :brTo download a model, open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   ollama pull <model_name>
   ```
   :brFor instance:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
3. **Configure the Model's Context Window:**
   By default, Ollama models often use a context window of 2048 tokens, which can be insufficient for many CodinIT.dev requests. A minimum of 12,000 tokens is advisable for decent results, with 32,000 tokens being ideal. To adjust this, you'll modify the model's parameters and save it as a new version. :br First, load the model (using `qwen2.5-coder:32b` as an example):
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
   :brOnce the model is loaded within the Ollama interactive session, set the context size parameter:
   ```text
   /set parameter num_ctx 32768
   ```
   :brThen, save this configured model with a new name:
   ```text
   /save your_custom_model_name
   ```
   :br(Replace `your_custom_model_name` with a name of your choice.)
4. **Configure CodinIT.dev:**
   - Open the CodinIT.dev sidebar (usually indicated by the CodinIT.dev icon).
   - Click the settings gear icon (⚙️).
   - Select "ollama" as the API Provider.
   - Enter the Model name you saved in the previous step (e.g., `your_custom_model_name`).
   - (Optional) Adjust the base URL if Ollama is running on a different machine or port. The default is `http://localhost:11434`.
   - (Optional) Configure the Model context size in CodinIT.dev's Advanced settings. This helps CodinIT.dev manage its context window effectively with your customized Ollama model.

### Tips and Notes

- **Resource Demands:** Running large language models locally can be demanding on system resources. Ensure your computer meets the requirements for your chosen model.
- **Model Choice:** Experiment with various models to discover which best fits your specific tasks and preferences.
- **Offline Capability:** After downloading a model, you can use CodinIT.dev with that model even without an internet connection.
- **Token Usage Tracking:** CodinIT.dev tracks token usage for models accessed via Ollama, allowing you to monitor consumption.
- **Ollama's Own Documentation:** For more detailed information, consult the official [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs){ariaLabel="Ollama Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.

A fully managed service that provides access to leading generative AI models—such as Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet v2—through Google Cloud. :br[Learn more about GCP Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai){rel="nofollow"}.

This guide is tailored for organizations with established GCP environments (leveraging IAM roles, service accounts, and best practices in resource management) to ensure secure and compliant usage.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Your GCP Environment

#### 1.1 Create or Use a GCP Project

- **Sign in to the GCP Console:**:br[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/){rel="nofollow"}
- **Select or Create a Project:**:br
  Use an existing project or create a new one dedicated to Vertex AI.

#### 1.2 Set Up IAM Permissions and Service Accounts

- **Assign Required Roles:**
  - Grant your user (or service account) the **Vertex AI User** role (`roles/aiplatform.user`)
  - For service accounts, also attach the **Vertex AI Service Agent** role (`roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent`) to enable certain operations
  - Consider additional predefined roles as needed:

    - Vertex AI Platform Express Admin
    - Vertex AI Platform Express User
    - Vertex AI Migration Service User
- **Cross-Project Resource Access:**
  - For BigQuery tables in different projects, assign the **BigQuery Data Viewer** role
  - For Cloud Storage buckets in different projects, assign the **Storage Object Viewer** role
  - For external data sources, refer to the [GCP Vertex AI Access Control documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control){rel="nofollow"}

---

### Step 2: Verify Regional and Model Access

#### 2.1 Choose and Confirm a Region

Vertex AI supports multiple regions. Select a region that meets your latency, compliance, and capacity needs. Examples include:

- **us-east5 (Columbus, Ohio)**
- **us-central1 (Iowa)**
- **europe-west1 (Belgium)**
- **europe-west4 (Netherlands)**
- **asia-southeast1 (Singapore)**
- **global (Global)**

The Global endpoint may offer higher availability and reduce resource exhausted errors. Only Gemini models are supported.

#### 2.2 Enable the Claude 4 Sonnet v2 Model

- **Open Vertex AI Model Garden:**:br
  In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Vertex AI → Model Garden**
- **Enable Claude 4 Sonnet v2:**:br
  Locate the model card for Claude 4 Sonnet v2 and click **Enable**

---

### Step 3: Configure the CodinIT.dev VS Code Extension

#### 3.1 Install and Open CodinIT.dev

- **Download VS Code:**:br[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){rel="nofollow"}
- **Install the CodinIT.dev Extension:**
  - Open VS Code
  - Navigate to the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
  - Search for **CodinIT.dev** and install the extension

![CodinIT.dev extension in VS Code](https://storage.googleapis.com/CodinIT.dev_public_images/docs/assets/CodinIT.dev-extension-arrow.png)

#### 3.2 Configure CodinIT.dev Settings

- **Open CodinIT.dev Settings:**:br
  Click the settings ⚙️ icon within the CodinIT.dev extension
- **Set API Provider:**:br
  Choose **GCP Vertex AI** from the API Provider dropdown
- **Enter Your Google Cloud Project ID:**:br
  Provide the project ID you set up earlier
- **Select the Region:**:br
  Choose one of the supported regions (e.g., `us-east5`)
- **Select the Model:**:br
  From the available list, choose **Claude 4 Sonnet v2**
- **Save and Test:**:br
  Save your settings and test by sending a simple prompt (e.g., "Generate a Python function to check if a number is prime.")

---

### Step 4: Authentication and Credentials Setup

#### Option A: Using Your Google Account (User Credentials)

1. **Install the Google Cloud CLI:**:br
   Follow the [installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install){rel="nofollow"}
2. **Initialize and Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   gcloud init
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   - This sets up Application Default Credentials (ADC) using your Google account
3. **Restart VS Code:**:br
   Ensure VS Code is restarted so that the CodinIT.dev extension picks up the new credentials

#### Option B: Using a Service Account (JSON Key)

1. **Create a Service Account:**
   - In the GCP Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**
   - Create a new service account (e.g., "vertex-ai-client")
2. **Assign Roles:**
   - Attach **Vertex AI User** (`roles/aiplatform.user`)
   - Attach **Vertex AI Service Agent** (`roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent`)
   - Optionally, add other roles as required
3. **Generate a JSON Key:**
   - In the Service Accounts section, manage keys for your service account and download the JSON key
4. **Set the Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
   ```
   - This instructs Google Cloud client libraries (and CodinIT.dev) to use this key
5. **Restart VS Code:**:br
   Launch VS Code from a terminal where the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable is set

---

### Step 5: Security, Monitoring, and Best Practices

#### 5.1 Enforce Least Privilege

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**:br
  Only grant the minimum necessary permissions. Custom roles can offer finer control compared to broad predefined roles
- **Best Practices:**:br
  Refer to [GCP IAM Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices){rel="nofollow"}

#### 5.2 Manage Resource Access

- **Project vs. Resource-Level Access:**:br
  Access can be managed at both levels. Note that resource-level permissions (e.g., for BigQuery or Cloud Storage) add to, but do not override, project-level policies

#### 5.3 Monitor Usage and Quotas

- **Model Observability Dashboard:**
  - In the Vertex AI Console, navigate to the **Model Observability** dashboard
  - Monitor metrics such as request throughput, latency, and error rates (including 429 quota errors)
- **Quota Management:**
  - If you encounter 429 errors, check the **IAM & Admin > Quotas** page
  - Request a quota increase if necessary :br[Learn more about GCP Vertex AI Quotas](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/quotas){rel="nofollow"}

#### 5.4 Service Agents and Cross-Project Considerations

- **Service Agents:**:br
  Be aware of the different service agents:
  - Vertex AI Service Agent
  - Vertex AI RAG Data Service Agent
  - Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent
  - Vertex AI Extension Service Agent
- **Cross-Project Access:**:br
  For resources in other projects (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage), ensure that the appropriate roles (BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Object Viewer) are assigned

---
