## Setup Guide

::alert{color="amber" icon="i-heroicons-clock"}
**Setup Time:** Approximately 5-10 minutes for first-time setup
::

::steps
### 1. Initiate GitHub Connection

In the CodinIT editor, click on **GitHub → Connect to GitHub** (usually found in the top-right corner of the project editor).

  :::callout{icon="i-heroicons-arrow-top-right-on-square"}
  This will redirect you to GitHub for authorization.
  :::

### 2. Authorize CodinIT on GitHub

You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the CodinIT GitHub App:

  :::tabs
    ::::div{label="All Repositories"}
    **Recommended for ease of use**
    
    Grants CodinIT access to create repositories in any of your accounts or organizations.
    ::::
  
    ::::div{label="Selected Repositories"}
    **More restrictive option**
    
    Choose specific repositories where CodinIT can operate. You can always modify this later.
    ::::
  :::

### 3. Select GitHub Account/Organization

  :::alert{color="yellow" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
  **Important:** You can only connect one GitHub account per CodinIT account at a time.
  :::

If your GitHub user belongs to organizations:

- Choose between personal GitHub or organization accounts
- Ensure you have admin access for organization repositories
- Repository will be created under the selected account

### 4. Create the Repository

Once GitHub is connected:

  :::code-group
  ```bash [Automatic Process]
  1. Click "Create Repository" button
  2. CodinIT creates new GitHub repo
  3. Initial code push (few seconds)
  4. Sync established ✅
  ```
  
  ```json [Repository Structure]
  {
    "name": "my-CodinIT-project",
    "visibility": "private",
    "default_branch": "main",
    "files": [
      "package.json",
      "src/",
      "public/",
      "README.md"
    ]
  }
  ```
  :::

### 5. Verify the Link

\::badge{variant="solid" color="green"}Connected::

Check your GitHub account for the new repository containing all your CodinIT app code.
\::

## How Syncing Works

  :::callout{color="blue" icon="i-heroicons-information-circle"}
  **Key Concept:** CodinIT and GitHub maintain a real-time, bidirectional sync of your codebase.
  :::

### Default Branch Sync Only

  :::alert{color="purple" icon="i-heroicons-git-branch"}
  **Important:** CodinIT currently tracks only the **default branch** of your GitHub repository (typically `main` or `master`).
  :::

  :::tabs
    ::::div{label="Supported"}
    ```bash
    # ✅ These changes sync with CodinIT
    git checkout main
    git commit -m "Add new feature"
    git push origin main
    ```
    ::::
  
    ::::div{label="Not Supported"}
    ```bash
    # ❌ These changes don't sync until merged
    git checkout feature/new-component
    git commit -m "Work in progress"
    git push origin feature/new-component
    ```
    ::::
  
    ::::div{label="Workflow"}
    ```bash
    # ✅ Proper workflow
    git checkout feature/new-component
    # ... make changes ...
    git push origin feature/new-component
    # Create PR and merge to main
    # Now changes appear in CodinIT!
    ```
    ::::
  :::

### Real-Time Updates

  :::code-group
  ```mermaid [GitHub → CodinIT]

      participant Dev as Developer
      participant GH as GitHub
      participant LV as CodinIT

      LV->>LV: Process changes
      LV->>GH: Auto-commit & push
      GH->>GH: Update repository
  ```
  :::

### Conflict Handling

  :::alert{color="red" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
  **Rare but possible:** Git conflicts can occur when both CodinIT and GitHub change the same code simultaneously.
  :::

  :::steps
  1. **Identify Conflict**:br Git will flag conflicting changes that can't be automatically merged.
  2. **Resolve Manually**:br Use GitHub's interface or local tools to resolve conflicts.
  3. **Commit Resolution**:br Push the resolved code back to the default branch.
  4. **Automatic Sync**:br CodinIT will pull the resolved code automatically.
  :::

## Importing Existing Repositories

  :::callout{color="amber" icon="i-heroicons-wrench-screwdriver"}
  **Coming Soon:** Direct import of existing repositories is planned for future updates.
  :::

### Current Workarounds

  :::tabs
    ::::div{label="Manual Import"}
      :::::steps
      1. Create new CodinIT project and connect to GitHub
      2. Clone the new (empty) repository locally
      3. Copy your existing code into the cloned repo
      4. Commit and push to the default branch
      5. CodinIT will sync the imported code automatically
      :::::
    ::::
  
    ::::div{label="Copy-Paste Method"}
    For smaller projects:
    
      :::::code-group
      ```bash [Terminal]
      # Copy individual files
      cp -r old-project/src new-project/src
      cp old-project/package.json new-project/
      ```
      
      ```javascript [CodinIT Editor]
      // Or paste code directly in CodinIT
      // Use AI to help restructure if needed
      ```

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

Check these common issues:

- **Branch**: Ensure you're pushing to the default branch (`main` or `master`)
- **Push Status**: Verify commits were successfully pushed to GitHub
- **Timing**: Wait 10-30 seconds for automatic sync
- **Refresh**: Try refreshing the CodinIT editor

  :::code-group
  ```bash [Check Status]
  git status
  git log --oneline -5
  git remote -v
  ```
  
  ```bash [Force Sync]
  git push origin main --force-with-lease
  # Then refresh CodinIT editor
  ```
  :::
::

\::

::steps
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings → General**
3. Find "Default branch" section
4. Click "Switch to another branch"
5. Select your desired branch
6. CodinIT will automatically start syncing with the new default
::

::alert{color="yellow" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
**Warning:** Switching default branches will change what code appears in CodinIT immediately.
::

CodinIT uses **GitHub webhooks** for real-time notifications:

```json
{
  "event": "push",
  "branch": "main",
  "commits": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "message": "Add new feature",
      "timestamp": "2025-06-16T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

When you push to the default branch, GitHub automatically notifies CodinIT, which then pulls the latest changes.

\::badge{variant="solid" color="green"}Yes, absolutely!::

Once connected to GitHub, you have full code ownership and can:

::list{icon="i-heroicons-check"}
- Deploy to any hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
- Set up your own CI/CD pipelines
- Continue editing in CodinIT while hosting elsewhere
- Maintain complete control of your codebase
- Export and modify code as needed
::

::code-group
```bash [Vercel Deployment]
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

```bash [Netlify Deployment]
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

```yaml [AWS CloudFormation]

If you need to use a custom base URL for the Anthropic API, check "Use custom base URL" and enter the URL. Most users won't need to adjust this setting.
::

## Extended Thinking

Anthropic models offer an "Extended Thinking" feature, designed to give them enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. This feature allows the model to output its step-by-step thought process before delivering a final answer, providing transparency and enabling more thorough analysis for challenging prompts.

::callout{color="green"}
When extended thinking is enabled in CodinIT, the model generates `thinking` content blocks that detail its internal reasoning. These insights are then incorporated into its final response.
::

CodinIT users can leverage this by checking the `Enable Extended Thinking` box below the model selection menu after selecting a Claude Model from any provider.

### Key Aspects of Extended Thinking

::field-group
  :::field{name="Supported Models" type="feature"}
  Available for select models, including variants of Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Sonnet 3.7. Models with the `:thinking` suffix are pre-configured in CodinIT.
  :::

  :::field{name="Summarized Thinking (Claude 4)" type="feature"}
  For Claude 4 models, the API returns a summary of the full thinking process to balance insight with efficiency. You are billed for the full thinking tokens, not just the summary.
  :::

  :::field{name="Streaming" type="feature"}
  Extended thinking responses, including the `thinking` blocks, can be streamed.

# Ollama

CodinIT.dev supports running models locally using Ollama. This approach offers privacy, offline access, and potentially reduced costs. It requires some initial setup and a sufficiently powerful computer. Because of the present state of consumer hardware, it's not recommended to use Ollama with CodinIT.dev as performance will likely be poor for average hardware configurations.

**Website:** <https://ollama.com/>{ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"}

### Setting up Ollama

1. **Download and Install Ollama:**
   Obtain the Ollama installer for your operating system from the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/){ariaLabel="Ollama Website" rel="nofollow"} and follow their installation guide. Ensure Ollama is running. You can typically start it with:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
2. **Download a Model:**
   Ollama supports a wide variety of models. A list of available models can be found on the [Ollama model library](https://ollama.com/library){ariaLabel="Ollama Model Library" rel="nofollow"}. Some models recommended for coding tasks include:
   - `codellama:7b-code` (a good, smaller starting point)
   - `codellama:13b-code` (offers better quality, larger size)
   - `codellama:34b-code` (provides even higher quality, very large)
   - `qwen2.5-coder:32b`
   - `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` (a solid general-purpose model)
   - `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base` (effective for coding)
   - `llama3:8b-instruct-q5_1` (suitable for general tasks)
   :brTo download a model, open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   ollama pull <model_name>
   ```
   :brFor instance:
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
3. **Configure the Model's Context Window:**
   By default, Ollama models often use a context window of 2048 tokens, which can be insufficient for many CodinIT.dev requests. A minimum of 12,000 tokens is advisable for decent results, with 32,000 tokens being ideal. To adjust this, you'll modify the model's parameters and save it as a new version. :br First, load the model (using `qwen2.5-coder:32b` as an example):
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
   ```
   :brOnce the model is loaded within the Ollama interactive session, set the context size parameter:
   ```text
   /set parameter num_ctx 32768
   ```
   :brThen, save this configured model with a new name:
   ```text
   /save your_custom_model_name
   ```
   :br(Replace `your_custom_model_name` with a name of your choice.)
4. **Configure CodinIT.dev:**
   - Open the CodinIT.dev sidebar (usually indicated by the CodinIT.dev icon).
   - Click the settings gear icon (⚙️).
   - Select "ollama" as the API Provider.
   - Enter the Model name you saved in the previous step (e.g., `your_custom_model_name`).
   - (Optional) Adjust the base URL if Ollama is running on a different machine or port. The default is `http://localhost:11434`.
   - (Optional) Configure the Model context size in CodinIT.dev's Advanced settings. This helps CodinIT.dev manage its context window effectively with your customized Ollama model.

### Tips and Notes

- **Resource Demands:** Running large language models locally can be demanding on system resources. Ensure your computer meets the requirements for your chosen model.
- **Model Choice:** Experiment with various models to discover which best fits your specific tasks and preferences.
- **Offline Capability:** After downloading a model, you can use CodinIT.dev with that model even without an internet connection.
- **Token Usage Tracking:** CodinIT.dev tracks token usage for models accessed via Ollama, allowing you to monitor consumption.
- **Ollama's Own Documentation:** For more detailed information, consult the official [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs){ariaLabel="Ollama Documentation" rel="nofollow"}.
