## Best Practices for Repository Import

### Pre-Import Preparation

::checklist
- [ ] Clean up unused files and dependencies.
- [ ] Ensure repository has clear folder structure.
- [ ] Add basic README with project description.
- [ ] Remove sensitive data and API keys.
- [ ] Create main branch with stable code.
::

### Post-Import Optimization

::tabs
  ::div{label="Code Organization"}
  **Organize code for better AI understanding:**
  - Use descriptive file and folder names.
  - Add comments explaining complex business logic.
  - Separate concerns into logical modules.
  - Maintain consistent coding style throughout.
  ::

  ::div{label="AI Prompting"}
  **Write effective prompts for existing codebases:**
  - Reference specific files and functions in prompts.
  - Explain existing patterns to maintain consistency.
  - Ask for incremental improvements rather than rewrites.
  - Use AI to understand code before making changes.
